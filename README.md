# âš¡ Lightweight.Caching

A collection of lightweight caching primitives.

LRU implementations are intended as an alternative to the System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache family of classes (e.g. HttpRuntime.Cache, System.Web.Caching et. al.), which cause heap allocations when the native object key is not type string.

# Overview

| Class | Description | Example use |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|
| ClassicLru      | Bounded size LRU based on a linked list and dictionary. | If strict ordering is important, but data structures are synchronized with a global lock which limits scalability. |
| ConcurrentLru      | Bounded size pseudo LRU, with LRU and TLRU policies. | Maintains psuedo order, but is faster than ClassicLru and not prone to lock contention. |
| SingletonCache      | Cache singletons by key. Discard when not in use. | Cache a semaphore per user, where user population is large, but active user count is low.   |

# Performance

## Meta-programming using structs for JIT dead code removal and inlining

ConcurrentLru features injectable policies defined as structs. Since structs are subject to special optimizations by the JITter, the implementation is much faster than if these policies were defined as classes. Using this technique, lookups without TTL are within 15% of the speed of a ConcurrentDictionary.

Since DateTime.UtcNow is around 4x slower than a ConcurrentDictionary lookup, policies that involve time based expiry are significantly slower. Since these are injected as structs and the slow code is optimized away, it is possible maintain the fastest possible speed for the non-TTL policy.

## ConcurrentLru Benchmarks

### Lookup speed

The cache contains a single item which is repeatedly fetched. Results represent raw lookup speed.

### Lookup speed with queue cycling

Cache contains 6 items, no items are evicted. The LRU caches maintaining item access order.
