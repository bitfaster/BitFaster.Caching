High performance, thread-safe in-memory caching primitives for .NET.

## ConcurrentLru

`ConcurrentLru` is a light weight drop in replacement for `ConcurrentDictionary`, but with bounded size enforced by the TU-Q eviction policy (based on [2Q](https://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P439.PDF)). There are no background threads, no global locks, concurrent throughput is high, lookups are fast and hit rate outperforms a pure LRU in all tested scenarios.

Choose a capacity and use just like `ConcurrentDictionary`, but with bounded size:

```csharp
int capacity = 128;
var lru = new ConcurrentLru<string, SomeItem>(capacity);

var value = lru.GetOrAdd("key", (key) => new SomeItem(key));
```

Optionally configure `ConcurrentLru` with a [time-based eviction policy](https://github.com/bitfaster/BitFaster.Caching/wiki/ConcurrentLru:-Time%E2%80%90based-eviction), either:
- Expire after write
- Expire after access
- Calculate an expiry time per item

## ConcurrentLfu

`ConcurrentLfu` is a drop in replacement for `ConcurrentDictionary`, but with bounded size enforced by the [W-TinyLFU admission policy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00727.pdf). `ConcurrentLfu` has near optimal hit rate and high scalability. Reads and writes are buffered then replayed asynchronously to mitigate lock contention.

Choose a capacity and use just like `ConcurrentDictionary`, but with bounded size:

```csharp
int capacity = 128;
var lfu = new ConcurrentLfu<string, SomeItem>(capacity);

var value = lfu.GetOrAdd("key", (key) => new SomeItem(key));
```

Optionally configure `ConcurrentLfu` with a [time-based eviction policy](https://github.com/bitfaster/BitFaster.Caching/wiki/ConcurrentLru:-Time%E2%80%90based-eviction), either:
- Expire after write
- Expire after access
- Calculate an expiry time per item
